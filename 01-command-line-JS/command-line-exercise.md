# Additional command line exercise

Complete the following instructions below in the Terminal application.

1. Within your `JSD` folder, create a folder titled `goals`.

2. Navigate into the `goals` folder, then create three empty files:
  - goals.html
  - worries.html
  - index.html

3. Open Visual Studio Code, click File > Open, navigate to your newly created `JSD/goals` folder, then open it. All 3 files you created should be displayed in the VS Code sidebar.

    In the respective files (goals.html and worries.html), write your top three goals and top three worries for this course.

    _Reminder_: to create an ordered list in HTML, use the following structure:
    ```html
    <ol>
      <li>Item 1 content</li>
      <li>Item 2 content</li>
    </ol>
    ```

4. Paste the following contents into index.html:

    ```html
    <html>
    <head></head>
    <body>
      <a href="goals.html"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/dosK05U.gif" /></a>
      <br>
      <a href="worries.html"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/2s0HwpM.gif" /></a>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

5. Save your changes to all 3 files.

6. Open index.html with your browser. Each image is a link to one of the other files you created.

7. Follow each link, then make sure you see your goals and worries in the linked files.
